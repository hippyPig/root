dendrology
==========

Dendrology is the study of trees.
These C++ functions and classes make ROOT's TTrees a little more streamlined (at least for my use).
The main classes are as follows:

* Monkey is a branch handler for TTrees.
* Barrel contains multiple Monkey's.
* Knives are for cutting.
* Elm wraps a TTree, and handles branches with a Barrel. Initially all branches are switched off for fast running, can also get TLorentzVectors on the fly and other convenient things.
* Oi is the messaging system.
